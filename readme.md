## Little Brick Out - My version

My dad is a university professor (Physics and Math.)
One year, I must have been under 6 years old, he brought home his department's Apple II computer for the Christmas break. One of the first games that I remember playing was **Little Brick Out**

This weekend's project was to learn PyGame. 
As am learning PyGame this game is growing from my learning. Here is my version of little brick out. 

Enjoy, or remix this as you wish. 

### Interesting Fact
Steve Wozniak actually programmed the first **Little Brick Out** game.
