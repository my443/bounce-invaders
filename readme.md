## Little Brick Out - My version

My dad is a university professor (Physics and Math.)
One year, I must have been under 6 years old, he brought home his department's Apple II computer for the Christmas break. One of the first games that I remember playing was **Little Brick Out**

This weekend's project was to learn PyGame. As I did, the game that grew from my learning is my version of little brick out. Enjoy, or remix this as you wish. 

### Interesting Fact
Steve Wozniak actually programmed the first **Little Brick Out** game.
